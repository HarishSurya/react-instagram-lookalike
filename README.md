# Project "Instagram mock-up"

**Disclaimer**: 
1. This was an exercise from DCI's WEB Development Course, which I attended between 2019 - 2021. 
2. This project is just for learning purpose. 

#### The mainly tasks were: 
- Build your own **data.json** which contains all the information about posts;
- Use **Sass** for this build;
- Feel free to have any other artist or celebrity or even your own photos;
- Consider that you have to use **props** and pass data to components;

> I've decided to seize the opportunity and add more features to this Project, therefore the new ROADMAP for this project is the follow..
### Project Roadmap
